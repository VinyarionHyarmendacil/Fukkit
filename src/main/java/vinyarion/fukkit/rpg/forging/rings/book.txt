Lore:    This book seems like it is very old,
    so old that the pages are almost too
    fragile to even touch. Somehow, it
    seems that it is preserved by magic,
    but who would want to keep a book
    safe for thousands or years?

        Herein is set forth my record of Ring-making.
        Many desire to learn this art, but few ever learn skills enough to teach others.
        Thus I write this book, to keep for future readers the knowledge of the craft.
        I shall begin with the fundamentals.
    2:
        Getting Started
        To begin, you must have a Blacksmith's Hammer.
        To craft one, place a three iron ingots in an anvil.
        Next, turn it into a Ringsmith's Hammer by placing the Blacksmith's Hammer in the left anvil slot with two mithril ingots, one each in the top and bottom slots.

        General Principles
        In order to forge rings, you need rings of course.
        Any of the five types will do.
        In general, "forging [item] with [other]" means placing [item] in the left slot of the anvil, [other] in the top, and a Ringsmith's hammer on the bottom.

        Rings
        Heat any ring first in order to modify it.
        This is done by forging it with Durnaur.
        To make a ring wearable again, but freeze its attributes, forge it with Edhelvir.
        This can be done as many times as desired.
        Once a ring is cooled, you can right click whilst holding it to put it on.
        The effects currently on the ring will be given to you, and the remaining time will decrease.
        If the ring is removed from your hotbar, you will cease its use and wear.

        Forging grades
        There are several forging grades that Hammers, Upgrades, Rings, and Gems can have.
        These are:
        -Normal
        -Common
        -Uncommon
        -Heroic
        -Rare
        -Epic
        -Legendary
        -Mythical
        -Mythical+
        -Mythical++
        
        When forging Upgrades, Rings, and Gems, the grade of the result is dependent on the grade of the hammer used in the bottom slot:
        -There is a 50% chance you will make a mistake.
        -There is a 30% chance it will be the same grade.
        -There is a 10% chance it will be the grade immediately inferior.
        -There is a 9% chance it will be the grade immediately superior.
        -There is a 1% chance it will be the grade twice superior.
        If there is no such grade, the result will default to the same grade as the hammer (or the highest, in the last case).
        You can also reduce the chance you will make a mistake by having a good Luck stat.
    7:
        Upgrades
        Your hammer starts out at the Normal grade.
        Upgrades are made by forging Mithril ingots.
        To upgrade your hammer, place the hammer on the top and the upgrade on the left.
        Your hammer also gets repaired in the process.
        
        Higher grades give gems longer efects and rings more effect slots.
        For example: a Normal Ruby gives 1 minute of Strength, but a Rare Ruby gives 3.
        Or for rings: a Common ring has 2 slots, but a Legendary has 7.
    9:
        Gems
        You can forge gems by themselves to imbue them with powers.
        The powers are as follows:
        -Topaz gives Fire Resistance
        -Amythyst gives Haste
        -Sapphire gives Night Vision
        -Ruby gives Strength
        -Amber gives Saturation
        -Diamond gives Resistance
        -Pearl gives Regeneration
        -Opal gives Speed
        -Emerald gives Jump
        -Coral gives Water Breathing
        It is rumored that a terrible firey monster of old will drop a dust that can grant invisibility when forged, but what that creature is and the name of the powder is lost to time.
        It is also believed that some way exists to force the effects of ill upon your enemies, but if it exists, it has not yet been found.
