This mod adds the functionality of the Groovy language to executing command scripts.
This allows you to add randomness or conditions to the execution of ommands.
In one groovy-enabled script, there are four times/ways you can have commands executed:
    - When the script loads
    - When it begins execution
    - The main execution itself
    - A seperate thread executes the desired content, lets you pause for certain amounts of time

To use one or more of these, you have to write one or more of the following:

    void init() {
        // Does this on script load
    }
    void start() {
        // Does this when script begins execution
    }
    void run() {
        // The main execution of a script, happens sequentially: it finishes before other server tasks can happen
    }
    void thread() {
        // Threaded execution of a script, happens in parallel: other server tasks happen before it finishes
    }
